# Device Naming Convention

When naming or referring to smart home devices (in HA or in code/docs), use this pattern so the AI and automations stay consistent.

## Pattern

**[Room] [Fixture / Level] [Description]**

| Part | Meaning | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Room** | Area/room name | Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Office |
| **Fixture / Level** | Where or what kind of fixture | Ceiling, Floor, Desk, Wall, Bedside |
| **Description** | What it is / does | Lamp, Switch, Blinds, Fan, Thermostat |

## friendly_name (in Home Assistant)

- Title Case, same order: Room + Fixture/Level + Description.
- Examples: "Living Room Ceiling Lamp", "Kitchen Floor Lamp Switch", "Bedroom Ceiling", "Office Desk Lamp".

## entity_id (when editable)

- snake_case, same order: `{room}_{fixture}_{description}`.
- Examples: `light.living_room_ceiling_main`, `switch.kitchen_floor_lamp`, `cover.living_room_blinds`.
- Many entity IDs are set by integrations and cannot be changed; apply the convention to **friendly_name** and, where possible (helpers, new devices), to **entity_id**.

## Areas

- Assign every device to an **area** in Home Assistant so "room" is unambiguous and list_entities/get_areas align with the convention.
