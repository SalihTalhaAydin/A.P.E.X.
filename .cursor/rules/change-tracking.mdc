# Change Tracking

After completing any significant change (new feature, bug fix, config change, architecture change, dependency update), you MUST update the documentation before finishing.

## 1. Update CHANGELOG.md

Append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under the current version heading. If the version was bumped, create a new heading.

Format:

```
## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed
- **Summary of change** -- brief why. Key files: `path/to/file.py`, `path/to/other.py`.
```

Rules:
- Use the correct date (check system date).
- Group entries under Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed.
- Include the specific files that were modified so future sessions can trace changes.
- Keep each entry to 1-2 lines. Be specific, not vague.
- If multiple changes are made in one session, list them all under the same version/date.

## 2. Update apex-project.mdc When Needed

If the change affects any of the following, update `.cursor/rules/apex-project.mdc` to match:
- Project structure (new directories, files, or modules)
- Architecture (new endpoints, changed data flow, new components)
- Tool system (new tools added or removed)
- HA add-on configuration (config.yaml, Dockerfile, run.sh, build system)
- Key conventions or development workflow
- Gotchas and lessons learned (add new discoveries)

Only edit the specific sections that changed. Do NOT rewrite the entire file.

## 3. What Counts as "Significant"

Update docs for:
- Any code change that would confuse a future AI session if undocumented
- Bug fixes (especially ones with non-obvious root causes)
- New tools, endpoints, or integrations
- Config or infrastructure changes
- Dependency additions or version bumps
- Lessons learned from debugging

Skip docs for:
- Typo fixes, comment-only changes, formatting
- Exploratory reads with no code changes
- Changes the user explicitly says not to document

## 4. Version Bumping

- Bump the patch version in `apex_brain/config.yaml` when deploying a fix or minor change.
- Bump the minor version for new features or significant additions.
- Always keep `config.yaml` version and `CHANGELOG.md` heading in sync.
