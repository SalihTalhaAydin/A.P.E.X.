# Apex Brain – Agent Instructions

- You are working on the Apex Brain add-on. Architecture and conventions are in `.cursor/rules/apex-project.mdc`.
- Follow change-tracking and apex-orchestration rules.
- Run tasks in parallel when possible; complete implementations end-to-end without asking for confirmation unless critical.
- APEX-specific preferences → `.cursor/rules/`; generic preferences → user-level (remind the user to update their User Rules if needed).
